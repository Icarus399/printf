_printf [arguments ...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\n
_printf function formats and prints its arguments, after the first, under control of the format.
The prototype of _prinft works with a constant char pointer format which contains four types of objects: 
strings, which are simply copied to standard output, character escape sequences which are copied to the standar output, digits and integer, which work with a
loop to get the numbers and format specifications, each of which causes printing of the next successive argument.
\n
The format string is reused as often as necessary to satisfy the arguments. Any extra format specifications are evaluated with zero or the null string.
\n
