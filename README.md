This is a project to create a printf function in the C language.
It practically works similarly as the printf function in the C language.

The printf function in C language is a control parameter used by a class of functions in the input/output libraries of C and many other programming languages.
The string is written in a simple template language: characters are usually copied literally into the function's output, but format specifiers, which start with a % character, indicate the location and method to translate a piece of data (such as a number) to characters. 

if our printf is compiled and if done correctly, our code should be able to take any input and execute into printing a string of characters excluding the null bytes.

There have yet to have been bugs found in this custom printf function.
